# Welcome to Esprit Web Application

Welcome to Esprit, a comprehensive platform designed to streamline administrative HR operations within academic institutions.

## Event Management

As my primary responsibility, managing events within the platform involves adding new events with various characteristics such as limited or unlimited places.

- **Event Characteristics**:
  - Limited or Unlimited Places
  - Location, including integration with Google Maps for precise locations

For events with limited places, students must register through the website to secure a spot. Meanwhile, events without limitations allow students to attend without prior registration through the platform.

## Student Registration

During the registration process, students have the option to specify their educational background:

- **High School**
- **Preparatory School**

### Dynamic Form Fields

Based on the selected educational background, relevant form fields are dynamically displayed:

- **High School**:
  - Fields for high school information
  
- **Preparatory School**:
  - Fields specific to preparatory school details

### Document Upload

Students are required to upload relevant documents based on their educational background, which may include:

- Transcript or academic records
- Identification documents
- Any specific documents required for admission

## Application Submission

Upon successful completion of the registration process, users can submit their application.

## Confirmation and Email Notification

After submission, a confirmation message is displayed on the platform, and an email containing details about the next steps in the admission process is sent to the user.

Thank you for choosing Esprit for your administrative HR needs in academic institutions!
